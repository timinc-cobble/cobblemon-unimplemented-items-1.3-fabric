### Bottle Caps

A beautiful bottle cap that gives off a silver gleam. While fishing, if you happen to fish up a treasure, there is a 1 in 10 chance of also obtaining a Bottle Cap. Alone, this Bottle Cap is not very useful, but if you craft it together with the right type of Apricorn, you can give the Bottle Cap a stat according to the chart below. When a Bottle Cap with a stat is used on a trainer Pokémon, it will raise that stat’s IV to max, if possible. You can check your Pokémon’s IVs in the party menu.

| Apricorn Color | Stat |
| --- | --- |
| Black | Attack |
| Yellow | Defense |
| Red | HP |
| Blue | Special Attack |
| Green | Special Defense |
| Pink | Speed |

### Golden Bottle Cap

A beautiful bottle cap that gives off a golden gleam. While fishing, if you happen to fish up a treasure, there is a 1 in 100 chance of also obtaining a Golden Bottle Cap. When used on a trainer Pokémon, it will raise all of that Pokémon’s IVs to maximum if possible.
